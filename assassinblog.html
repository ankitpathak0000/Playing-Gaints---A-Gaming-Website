    <div id="content">Every gamer new and old has played or at least heard of the Assassin’s Creed sequel. The
        action-packed game features everything a player is looking for. There's blood, gore and plenty of history for
        you to reminisce on.

        Since the first release of the game in 2007, there are several other series that have come out. Every hardcore
        PC gamer probably has all of them in their collection. If you don’t already own them and are considering buying
        the games, here is a full list of the Assassin’s Creed games in their sequential order for you to play on your
        Fierce Gaming PC.
        <br>
        <br> ASSASSIN’S CREED – 2007 <br>
        


       When Assassin’s Creed first came out, it was quite the eye-catcher. It had a unique storyline based on the
        medieval era of the Middle East, which was the origin of the character Altair Ibn La-Ahad who was the assassin.

        Unfortunately, players who had the privilege of playing the game then commented on how repetitive the game was.
        The builders of the game, however, used its success as a launching pad for the series that were to follow.
        Seeing how successful it became, it's safe to assume they didn't repeat the same mistake.

        You can watch the trailer here.
